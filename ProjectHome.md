With this project, we develop an openrtm interface for the dual arm robot HiroNX. The software is composed of two RT components; HiroNXProvider providing the function for operating the robot HiroNX and HiroNXGUI consuming the provided function on the graphical user interface.

We confirmed on Ubuntu 10.04 32bit with OpenRTM 1.0 and 1.1.
